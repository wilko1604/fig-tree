			<h3>Why is this what it is?</h3>
			
			<p>This website is a sandbox site, rather than a portfolio. I aim to use this as a way to practice what i learn regarding HTML, CSS and Javascript. The content of this website is here for that exact reason. Content. I decided to use my builds to push me to build more refined creations while also giving myself a decent ground of what I can add to this website. </p>

				<h3>Fig Tree?</h3>
				<p>The title fig tree was written on a whim, having a fig tree infront of me did help the decision. Anyway, turns out I didnt hate having the words "fig tree" glaring at me everytime I edit the docments or reload the website. Which brings us here. </p>

				<h3>Well... Whats the content?</h3>
				
				<p>I'm glad you asked... Here I present to you at colection of home builds I have worked on. These builds have become a standard creative output in my life serving my aesthetic preferences while creating a more efficient and comfortable personal space. I've found I enjoy all the aspects of my builds from the thought and designing, to the construction to the satisfction of a completed product.</p>
